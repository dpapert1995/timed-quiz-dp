# Timed Coding Quiz

## Purpose
A coding quiz with questions on HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
Randomly chooses from a bank of 12 questions to generate a
99 second, 5 question quiz. The user's score for each question
is calculated as follows:

Score = 100/([time at beginning of question]-[time at end of question])

The maximum total score is 500. Since the time is rounded, down, a max score
of 100 is rewarded each question (to prevent an infinite score).

## Built With
* HTML 
* CSS
* Javascript
